Collection of some marketing [FUD (Fear, Uncertaintity, and Doubt)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear%2C_uncertainty%2C_and_doubt) in the InfoSec industry.

While quotes or phrases from organisations will be placed here, the organisations will be kept anonymous. Hopefully this will be a useful tool which organisations use as a reference to determine quotes or phrases which may have a negative connotation.

## Jargon
* **Unhackable**: Nothing is unhackable!
* **100% secure**: See unhackable.
* **Military grade encryption**: Yes there is such a thing as military grade encryption. It's just that it's not that special. All "military grade encryption" really means is AES-256 encryption. Something that a vast majority of devices and services support today. In fact it would be an exception for a device or service to not support this form of encryption.
* **Bank grade encryption**: See military grade encryption (also stands for AES-128 encryption, although by some it is considered AES-256 encryption).
* **Best in class**: Prove it! And let us be the judges of that.
* **World leader**: See best in class.
* **Next gen**: When was 1st gen? Yes, this is IT, new things happen. This is not something special.
* **Blockchain**: Blockchain does have a use. However it is limited in its capabilities. Blockchain is not the solution to EVERYTHING! Also many services are making use of this technology, it's not any more special than something like AES-256.
* **AI**: Artificial Intelligence. This has been around for a while. Broken down to its simplest form, it's little more than a bunch of if else statements.
* **Zero-day**: Also known as a 0-day. This is when software has a vulnerability but not patch or fix is availble to fix the vulnerability. These are certainly a concern, however attackers are often unlikely to burn an unknown zero-day, they'll keep them for a special occassion. You are far more likely to be breached by a known vulnerablitity (and typically has a fix, but systems aren't updated), or human error (such as misconfigurations).
* **Digital Transformation**: The whole of IT is a “digital transformation”! It’s constantly changing on a daily basis often at a rapid pace.

## Phrases
* **We take your security seriously**: This phrase is most often associated with a breach notification. Most often it carries the perception that these are merely words, attempting to downplay a bad situation. This is equivalent of the phrase "It's not you, it's me", being mentioned during a relationship breakup. Also you uttering these words during a breach notification, explaining how you've lost my data. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for how well you take my security.

## Moar FUD
* **Bulletproof authentication**: Bulletproof glass? Sure! Bulletproof vest? Certainly! Bulletproof authentication? I'm still trying to work that one out, since authentication typically doesn't involve any firearms (to the best of my knowledge).
